## Description:
This is a simple note taker app that uses the Express framework to establish api routes and HTTP requests. This application has a back end and a front end that is required to function properly. The server side listens for a request from the client and then responds accordingly whether a note is to be taken, saved or deleted. Express is challenging because there are a lot of things going on from front end to back end, working with middleware and understanding request-response patterns takes time to understand as well. I do like working with Express combining back end and front end technologies as it is clean, fast and is a lightweight framework. 

## Initialization:
Use `node server.js` to install and will then listen for localhost:8080.
